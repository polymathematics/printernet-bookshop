            <h2>How the bookshop works</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Printernet Bookshop, an internet bookshop for peer to peer book swapping. You can browse the bookshop to find books you want to read, and you can also add books to your own shelf that you're willing to trade for a new book. Once you see a book you like, offer one of your own as a trade. If the other person accepts, you'll receive one another's addresses and can mail the books to each other using the USPS Media Mail rate ($4.00), the cheapest shipping rate in the country.</p>

            <h2>How to join</h2>
            <p>To join the bookshop, you just need to sign up below. There is a monthly fee of $5.00. If you swap one book a month, that's $9.00 for a new book each month - pretty good! Plus you get to be part of a digital-physical network of readers, trading physical media by hand and extending the lifetime of your books.</p>
